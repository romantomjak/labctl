## Status

This project is in development phase. If you think it could be useful to you as well, you can download and install it using go get:

```sh
go get -u github.com/romantomjak/labctl
```

## Usage

To interact with proxmox clusters, you need to specify `PROXMOX_ADDR`, `PROXMOX_USER` and `PROXMOX_PASSWORD`
environment variables.

```sh
$ PROXMOX_ADDR=https://pve.somehost.com:8006
$ PROXMOX_USER=root
$ PROXMOX_PASSWORD=somepassword
$ labctl ps
ID   NAME           NODE   STATUS   UPTIME     MEM    CPU       
100  ceph-1         pve01  running  19h56m46s  15 GB  0.27871  
101  k8s-control-1  pve01  running  8h2m32s    2.7 GB 0.30397  
102  vault          pve01  stopped  0s         0 B    0  
104  k8s-worker-1   pve01  running  8h2m45s    4.5 GB 0.19541  
$ labctl start vault
üö¶ Will start the VMs in the following order:
  - vault
‚ùì Do you want to continue? [y/n] y
üöÄ Starting the VMs
  - vault... OK ‚úÖ
```

Alternatively, if the proxmox nodes are not in a cluster, it is possible to specify
each host via the `PROXMOX_NODES` environment variable. This will make it possible
to work with virtual machines on different hosts as if they were part of the same
cluster.

```sh
$ PROXMOX_NODES=https://root:somepassword@pve.somehost.com:8006,https://root:somepassword@pve2.somehost.com:8006
$ labctl ps
ID   NAME           NODE   STATUS   UPTIME     MEM     CPU       
100  ceph-1         pve01  running  19h56m46s  15 GB   0.27871  
101  k8s-control-1  pve01  running  8h2m32s    2.7 GB  0.30397  
102  vault          pve01  stopped  0s         0 B     0  
104  k8s-worker-1   pve01  running  8h2m45s    4.5 GB  0.19541  
101  ceph-2         pve02  running  19h56m36s  23 GB   0.11695  
102  k8s-control-2  pve02  running  8h2m34s    2.9 GB  0.65052  
103  k8s-worker-2   pve02  running  8h2m15s    12 GB   0.33866  
104  time-machine   pve02  running  0s         4.0 GB  0
